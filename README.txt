Welcome to the official-ish UCSD neurograd MATLAB bootcamp/tutorial.  It should take a few hours to read and step through all of the code. Just open the Tutorial '.m' file in the MATLAB Editor, put a breakpoint on the first executable line, and then run <F5> and step through <F10> while reading all the glorious comments.
